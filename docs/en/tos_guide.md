The tos command is a build tool for tuyaopen, supporting various functions such as creating, compiling, and configuring.

The tos command is located in the root directory of [tuyaopen](https://github.com/tuya/tuyaopen.git) and is implemented using shell scripts. Before using it, you need to add the path of tuyaopen to the system environment variable.

## Command List

## Usage Examples

### View Version
```shell
$ tos version
1.0.0
```

### Check Current Environment
```shell
$ tos check
Check command and version ...
Check [python3](3.10.12) > [3.6.0]: OK.
Check [git](2.34.1) > [2.0.0]: OK.
Check [cmake](3.22.1) > [3.16.0]: OK.
Check [ccmake](3.22.1) > [3.16.0]: OK.
Check [lcov](1.14) > [1.14]: OK.
```

The tos check command will check whether the current environment meets the build requirements. If it does, it will output OK. If not, it will prompt for the minimum version required, such as `Please install [lcov], and version > [1.14]`. Please install the relevant dependencies and corresponding versions according to the check results.

### Create Project
```shell
$ tos new
```
1. Enter the project name according to the prompt, such as: `hello_world`.
2. Select the platform corresponding to the project:
```shell
Choice platform ...
========================
Platforms
  1. t2
  2. t3
  3. ubuntu
------------------------
Please select: 
```
After the selection, tos will automatically download the relevant dependency files and generate the project directory and template files.
```shell
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── project_build.ini
└── src
    └── hello_world.c
```
Among them:
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Project configuration file, used to configure project compilation options.
- `project_build.ini`: Project configuration file, used to configure project compilation options.
    - The project name is the project name + platform name.
    - The platform is the platform corresponding to the project.
- `src`: Source code directory, used to store project source code files.
- `src/hello_world.c`: Project source code file, used to store project source code.

### Compile Project

Enter the project directory and run the following command:
```shell
$ cd hello_world
$ tos build
```

### Configure Project
Enter the project directory and run the following command:
```shell
$ cd hello_world
$ tos menuconfig
```

### Clean Project
Enter the project directory and run the following command:
```shell
$ cd hello_world
$ tos clean
```

## Multi-platform Configuration
The tos tool configures multi-platform compilation through the project_build.ini file in the project engineering directory. The configuration file format is as follows:
```ini
[project:switch_demo_t2]
platform = t2

[project:switch_demo_t3]
platform = t3
```

By default, there is only 1 project in project. If you need to compile multiple projects, you need to add multiple project configurations in the project_build.ini file.

When there are multiple projects in the configuration file, the `tos build` command will compile multiple projects in sequence.

## Compile All Projects in the Specified Directory
```shell
$ tos build_all .
```
Tos will compile all projects in the specified directory according to the project configuration files under the project engineering directory.
